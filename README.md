# RTL8821CU Driver, Version 5.8.1. for Linux v5.6
This is my own revision of the driver, available from D-Link/Realtek,
for the RTL8821CU chipset to make it functional on the Linux 5.6
Kernel.

I provide no warranty with this code, as I only made the modifications
so that my DLink DWA-171 USB WiFi Adapter is functional on ArchLinux.
That said, maybe the modifications I made may prove useful to you.
